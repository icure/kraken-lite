 * This cache lives is stored in each reactor context and is deleted after the completion of the function.
 *
 * @param cacheSize the maximum size of the cache for each type of entity. If data is batched the recommended cache size
 * is batchSize * 2. This way if the same element is needed in two different batches it may still be available.
