 * @property hcPartyKeys For each couple of HcParties (delegator and delegate), this map contains the exchange AES key. The delegator is always this hcp, the key of the map is the id of the delegate. The AES exchange key is encrypted using RSA twice : once using this hcp public key (index 0 in the Array) and once using the other hcp public key (index 1 in the Array). For a pair of HcParties. Each HcParty always has one AES exchange key for himself.
 * @property privateKeyShamirPartitions The privateKeyShamirPartitions are used to share this hcp's private RSA key with a series of other hcParties using Shamir's algorithm. The key of the map is the hcp Id with whom this partition has been shared. The value is \"threshold|partition in hex\" encrypted using the the partition's holder's public RSA key
 * @property publicKey The public key of this actor
 * @property publicKeysForOaepWithSha256 The public keys of this actor which should be used for RSA-OAEP with sha256 encryption
