/**
 * Created by aduchate on 06/07/13, 10:09
 *
 * This entity represents a sub-contact. It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying icure-contact CouchDB database.
 *
 * A sub-contact represents the links between a series of services contained in a contact to other structuring elements such a sa healthcare element, healthcare approach, forms, etc.
 * A Contact conforms to a series of interfaces:
 * - StoredICureDocument
 * - Encryptable
 *
 * @property id The Id of the sub-contact. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @property created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of the sub-contact, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of the sub-contact, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property author The id of the User that has created this sub-contact, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this sub-contact, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @property medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where the sub-contact was created.
 * @property tags Tags that qualify the sub-contact as being member of a certain class.
 * @property codes Codes that identify or qualify this particular sub-contact.
 * @property endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @property descr Description of the sub-contact
 * @property protocol Protocol based on which the sub-contact was used for linking services to structuring elements
 * @property status
 * @property formId Id of the form used in the sub-contact. Several sub-contacts with the same form ID can coexist as long as they are in different contacts or they relate to a different planOfActionID
 * @property planOfActionId Id of the plan of action (healthcare approach) that is linked by the sub-contact to a service.
 * @property healthElementId Id of the healthcare element that is linked by the sub-contact to a service
 * @property classificationId
 * @property services List of all services provided to the patient under a given contact which is linked by this sub-contact to other structuring elements.
 * @property encryptedSelf The encrypted fields of this sub-contact.
