This key will be used by the client to calculate the keys of [SecurityMetadata.secureDelegations] in
[HasSecureDelegationsAccessControl.securityMetadata] which allows to implement a form of access control where the
identity of data owners with access to a specific entity can't be deduced from the database alone. This is useful
for example to allow patients to access their medical data without creating a deducible link between the patient
and the medical data in the database.
There are no strict requirements on how the client should use this secret to create the security metadata key,
but for authentication the client must be able to provide a 128 bit long access control key (see
[DataOwnerAuthenticationDetails.accessControlKeys]) which once hashed using sha256 will give the key of the
security metadata.
However, in order to avoid introducing undesired links between entities which could be detrimental to the
patients privacy the access control keys should be created also using information on the entity class and secret
foreign keys of the entity holding the delegation, in order to ensure that in case of different confidentiality
settings for the entity the security metadata key will also be different and won't leak information on links
between data.
